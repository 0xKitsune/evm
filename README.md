# Alloy-EVM

## Overview

`alloy-evm` is an abstraction layer on top of [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) providing common implementations of EVMs. Currently, alloy-evm is only used in Reth but is designed to be consumed by any project that needs to execute transactions or blocks on EVM compatible chains.
